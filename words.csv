you

the

the
worst
thing
you
can
possibly
do
in
a
deal
is
seem
desperate
to
make
it
the
art
of
the
deal
unfortunately@barackobama's
continued
attack
on
the
us
$
will
lead
to
ever
rising
gas
prices
at
the
pump
and
lots
of
other
really
bad
things
the
answer
to
both
social
security
and
medicare
is
a
robust
growing

@ld06981p
larry,
thank
you

keep
up
the
great
work
the
democrats
have
zero
intention
of
coming
to
any
deal
on
the
fiscal
cliff
they
will
raise
taxes

blame
it
on

scottish
government

@alexsalmond

the

just
didn’t
resonate
with
the

they
will
have
better
days
i’m

that

amazing,
various

you
the

everybody

just
don’t

in

loved

a
lot
of
people
are
concerned
about
which
charity
my
$5m
will
be
donated
to
the
onus
is
on
obama
to
first
release
his
records
people
are
struggling
to
get

are
like
a
third
world
country
people
having
a
great
time
in
the
trump
tower
atrium
unlike
others,
i
stayed
open
http//tco/onelqemc
how
could
obama
leave
those
american
heroes
out
to
die
in
benghazi
and
he
continues
to
lie
to
the
public
my
@squawkcnbc
interview
discussing
the
57th
st
crane,
damage
from
the
storm
and
extending
my
$5m
offer
to
obama
http//tco/ebuofuw0
what
is
your
thought
as
to
why
obama
refused
millions
for
charity
and
did
not
show
his
records
and
applications
i
will
start
reviewing
various
political
reporters

http//tco/3xz74ipi
interestingly,
the
hurricane
may
now
be
a
disaster
for
obama's
reelection
because
of
his
grandstanding
the
president
has
until
tomorrow
at
12
noon
to
pick
up
$5m
for
his
favorite
charity
looking
like
he
won't
be
doing
it
what
is
he

these
last
4
years
have
not
had
a

quarter
over
4%

obama
has

would
rather
write
than
that
to
a
good
charity
designated
by
our
president
i
knew
last
year
that
@time
magazine
lost
all
credibility
when
they
didn't
include
me
in
their
top
100
i
am
happy
to
have
started
#obamasfavoritecharity
really
enjoying
reading
everyone's
tweets
i
just
learned
that
@politico
has
no
credibilitytotal
phonies
that
don't
report
the
truth
a
puppet
of
obama
looking
forward
to
being
the
special
guest
at
tonight's
dutchess
county
#gop
dinnerto
a
sold
out
crowd
it
will
be
great
fun
where's
the
transparency
despite
obama's
denial
@sfchronicle
stands
by
report
he
just
talked
with
jeremiah
wright
letterman
@late_show
was
great
last
night
i
had
a
lot
of
fun
you
could
see
his
audience
really
wanted
obama
to
take
the
$
for
charity
the
letterman
show
really
turned
things
around
people
finally
understand
my
$5
million
dollar
offer
to
charity

@bettemidler
talks
about
my
hair
but
i'm
not
allowed
to
talk
about
her
ugly
face
or
body
so
i
won't
is
this
a
double
standard
glad
to
hear
@seanhannity
supports
my
offer
to
obama
as
sean
says
“it
is
an
easy
$5
million
to
charity
what
does
obama
have
to
lose”
many
people
are
saying
that
my
challenge
to
obama
is
having
a
huge
negative
effect
on
his
poll
numbers
i
agree
by
the
way,
where
is
@oprah
good
question
4
years
ago
she
strongly
supported
obamanow
she
is
silent
anyway,
who
cares,
i
adore
oprah
before
star
jones
begged
me
to
put
her
on
the
apprentice
she
was
“professionally
dead”
i
saved

that

probably

a

for

the

is
still
close
but
trending
toward
@mittromney
he

stock

if

what
will
he
say

that

a

represented
so
well
by

lots
of

who
were
murdered
in

i
hope
so
for

what

well
this

the

on
only
one
subject
i
wish
tonight's

would
cover
more
than
foreign
policy
@bobschieffer
did
an
excellent
job
as
debate
moderator
last
night
i
only
wish
mitt
was
more
aggressive
lance
armstrong
fought
for
7
years
&amp
then
just
ran
out
of
energy
very
sad
storyalthough
they
caught
him
red
handedhe
definitely
cheated
why
don't
we
ask
the
navy
seals
who
killed
bin
laden
they
don't
seem
to
be
happy
with
obama
claiming
credit
all
he
did
is
say
ok
the
debate
was
pretty
even
but
i
thought
mitt
should
have
been
much
more
aggressive
on
obama's
failed
foreign
policy
and
i
mean
much
more
a
lot
of
the
@yankees
should
be
ashamed
of
their
play
in
the
post
season
they
are
lucky
they
don't
have
to
deal
with
george
steinbrenner
no
surprise,
welfare
spending
is
up
over
30%

planted

@nytimes

on

so
it
will
be

in
tonight's

he
wants
libya
and
china
off
the
table
@bbc

never
have

of

yet
the

are
ringing
off
the

@mittromney

@mittromney's

numbers
are
looking
really
good
one
more
great
debate
performance
and
it
will
be
a
total
knockout
what
we
are
watching
on
our
tv
screens
is
the
unraveling
of
the
obama
foreign
policy
@paulryanvp
@rupertmurdoch
is
absolutely
right,
it
will
be
a
nightmare
for
@israel
if
obama
is
reelected
looking
forward
to
speaking
at
tonight's

for
@mittromney

at
the
intrepid

doing
well

@dennisrodman
looks

he
really
cleaned

he
doesn't
make

@yankees
any
money
and
he
doesn't
perform
he
is
a
$30m/yr
rip
off
i
look
forward
to
tuesday
night's

wonder
if

will
use
my
name
again
i'm
going
to
the
@yankees
game
tonight
to
root
them
onthey
always
win
when
i
am
there
so
much
for
washington
shutting
down
strasburg
they
deserved
to
lose
obama's
economic
policies
are
causing
inflation
on
hard
working
families
the
price
of
corn
alone
has
risen
over
200%

obama

at

he

lose
the
boeing

strasburg

in
a

of

under

washington

@mittromney
looks

stronger
and
much
more
presidential
i
turned
down
going
to
the
debate
tonight
so
that
i
could
do
live
tweets
to
my
many
followers
based
on
very
popular
demand,
i
will
be
live
tweeting
tomorrow
night
during
the
presidential
debate
then
how
come
gasoline
is
hitting
record
high
prices
tonight,
despite
everything,
put
arod
in
the
lineup
obama
is
looking
rhetorical
and
weak
@mittromney
is
looking
strong
and
sharp
i
told
you,
whenever
i
go
to
a
@yankees
game
the
@yankees
win
arod
was
a
great
player
when
he
lived
at
trump
park
avenue
even
though
he
was
on
the
juice
@antbaxter
your
documentary
died
many
deaths
you
have,
in
my
opinion,
zero
talent
obama
just
said
@mittromney
was
a
very
successful
investor
big
mistake
for
obama
to
admit
he
has
less
and
less
credibility
once
again
obama
fails
to
classify
china
as
a
currency
manipulator
he
just
helped
china
steal
even
more
jobs
and
money
from
us
if
the
@yankees
can
somehow
beat
verlander
tonight
then
they
can
still
salvage
the
series
and
i
will
go
to
games
6&amp
7
so
they
will
win
i
have
never
seen
a
thin
person
drinking

@mittromney
much
better
on
libya
and
middle
east
problems
obama
has
no
answer
no,
i
wasn't
at
the
@yankees
game
yesterday
can't
go
today
either
when
i
go,
they
win
i
bet
the
terrorists
in
libya
used
weapons
we
supplied
them
during
their
so
called
'revolution'
to
attack
our
embassy
in
benghazi
between
libya,
the
national
security
leaks
and
fast
&amp
furious,
obama
has
had
more
national
security
scandals
than
any
other
president
swisher
should
have
caught
ball
in

no

why
hasn't

my
first
season
winner,
will
be
returning
to
this
allstar
season
of

because
obama
was
so
pathetic
in
the
first
debate,
tonight's
audience
will
be
humongouspeople
want
to
see
if
he
is

my
scotland
course
is
receiving
accolades
from
all
over

had
another
trillion
dollar
budget
deficit
for
the
fourth
year
in
a
row
at
least

is
consistent
@mittromneyif

tonight
just
ask
for
his

records
&amp

will
quiet
down
quickly
arod
hit

hard

time
for
him
to
step
up
and
leave
sometimes
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
just
let
things
ride,
let

go

trump
arod
is

not
making

it
was

obama's

'forward,'
they
take
us
'backwards'
these
are

at
this
point
the
legacy
of
the
obama
administration
will
be,
sadly,
that
of
the
gang
that
couldn't
shoot
straight
what
a
pathetic
mess
doing
fox
and
friends
in
two
minutes
@nymag
in
every
interview
new
york
magazine
has
done
for
years
they
ask
the
same
question
what
do
you
think
of
donald
trump
beggars
winner
of
the
5
star

award,

why
doesn't
president
obama
just
get
the
people
from
google
to
fix
the
failed
website
in
fact,
why
didn't
he
use
them
in
the
first
place
if
you
want
to
succeed,
keep
your
edge
staying
on
top
of
all
new
developments
in
your
sector

donald

do
not
attack
syria
there
is
no
upside

tremendous
downside
save

for
another
and
more
important
day
while
everyone
is
waiting
and
prepared
for
us
to
attack
syria,
maybe
we
should
knock
the
hell
out
of
iran
and
their
nuclear
capabilities
if
syria
was
forced
to
use
obamacare
they
would
selfdestruct
without
a
shot
being
fired
obama
should
sell
them
that
idea
@ericjgiroux
@realdonaldtrump
you

why

it
that

who
has
been

failed

he

the

if

fact
–
the
reason
why
americans
have
to
worry

what's

believe

it
ain't
easy
the

abuse
that
is
so
rampant
has,
according
to
generals,
greatly
weakened
our

they
have
failed
to
stop
it
@nymag

that

never

from

that

do
that

lance

very,very

brent

did
himself
a

what
everyone

he

much
more
popular
now
than
before

he
wants

he
really
feels

i'll

wishes
he
didn't
do
the

were
led

who
is
the
moron
who
decided
to
release
the
ferguson
grand
jury
findings
after
900
o'clock
in
the
evening
what

they
thinking
@pianobecca

omg
@realdonaldtrump
just
rtd
meee
yay
i
sooo
admire
him
i
cant
wait
for
him
to
be
my
presedent
#tump2016
sadly,
because
president
obama
has
done
such
a
poor
job
as
president,
you
won't
see
another
black
president
for
generations
@tylerclodfelter
@realdonaldtrump
found
your
locker
at
trump
national
we
had
an
awesome
time
http//tco/u404zzun6v
great
as
china
and
the
rest
of
the
world
continue
to
rip
off
the
us
economically,
they
laugh
at
us
and
our
president
over
the
riots
in
ferguson
@rafaelmerrydel1
the
carter
family
thanksgiving
will
be
a
bit
happier
as
obama
officially
becomes
the
worst
president
in
history
our
country
is
totally
fractured
and,
with
our
weak
leadership
in
washington,
you
can
expect
ferguson
type
riots
and
looting
in
other
places
@sjfloyd06
only
way
i'm
registering

why

at

in
the

a

not

there
is
no

for

in

regardless
of

outcome

–

@lukebryanonline
you
were
great
on
the
apprentice
congrats
on
your
big
cma
win
i
promise
i
won't
take
credit
for
your
successful
career
looking
like
a
really
big
night
for
republicans
a
tremendous
refutation
of
president
obama
and
his
failed
policies
a
really
bad
night
for
president
obama
now
the
republicans
have
to
get
together
and
get
the
job
done

in
just

months
today
the

lose

but
tomorrow

communicate
a
positive
progrowth
agenda
good
luck

being
stubborn
is

an

so

them
in

what
is
he

why
should
we

the

really
tarnished
now,
if

@kornegay_danna

a

why
americans

these

sickens
me
our

will

be
relegated

world
status
if
proper
decisions
are
not
made

still
do

what

is
that
we
never

was
terrible,

@nickkleutsch
@realdonaldtrump
@trumpchicago
personally
i
think
the
letters
should
be
higher
up
make
sure
everyone
can
see
that
name
iraq
told
us
to
get
out,
iraq
is
now
falling,
and
iraq
now
wants
us
to
come
back
don't
do
it
unless
we
get
the
oil,
and
i
mean
all
of
it
iraq
is
far
worse
and
of
more
danger
to
the
us
now
than
it
ever
was
under
saddam

this
after

bobbing
all

would'
into

they

what

ask

i
learn

that
i
didn't

always
be

always
be
open

if

became

he
would
do
an
amazing
job
if

took
over

apprentice,
he'd
fail
what's
your
opinion
i
agree

@realdonaldtrump
if
they

an
amazing
and
beautiful
course
it
is
more

a

it
is
immortal
rosechem1
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
like
you

i
feel

congrats
to
@alcardenasacu

i
really
enjoyed
being
there—the
response
was
so
terrific
amazing
how
the
press
protected
president
obama
when
he
did
the
socalled
comedy
routine
with
zach
g
he
looked
like
a
fool
they
said
cute
we
create
success
or
failure
on
the
course
primarily
by

you

of

laughable
@mckaycoppins

my

i
read
@willweatherford’s

that

could
be
worse
for

killing

said

@amarudacosta
sadly
@realdonaldtrump
was
correct
about

a
part
to
play
in

you
really

the

so,
since

@realdonaldtrump
@foxnews
so
far
this
is
one
of
the
best
interviews
with
trump
@mittromney
can
only
speak
negatively
about
my
presidential
chances
because
i
have
been
openly
hard
on
his
terrible
choke
loss
to
obama
i
will
be
interviewed
by
chris
wallace
at
200
pm
on

true
in

#makeamericagreatagain
does
everyone
remember
@mittromney
and
his
famous
remarks
about
selfdeportation
and
47%
he
was
done
i
don't
need

amazing
that
some

because
he
speaks
&amp
acts
like
a
real
person
not
like
a
slimy,
calculated
politician
jeb
bush
is
weak
on
illegal
immigration,
in
favor
of
common
core,
bad
on
women's
health
issues
and
thinks
the
iraq
war
was
a
good
thing
@swamp_bug
@seanhannity
cruz
is
my
second/third
choice
carson
is
also
a
good
man
i
look
at
it
as
war,
so
my
choice
is
trump
i
had
15,000
people
in
phoenix
but
@politico
said
the
rooms
capacity
is
just
over
2000
but
said
bernie
sanders
had
11,000
in
same
room

@realdonaldtrump
no
man
or
women
on
this
planet
can
give
us
back
america
with
the
exception
of
@realdonaldtrump
leadership
i
liked
the
kelly
file
much
better
without
@megynkelly
perhaps
she
could
take
another
eleven
day
unscheduled

@john_franco
when
people
start
losing
their

&amp

fix

president
obama,
you
have
a
big
job
to
do
go
to
baltimore
and
bring
both
sides
together
with
proper
leadership,
it
can
be
done
do
it
i
wonder
what
the
rest
of

is
thinking
about
the

states
as
they
watch
the
disgusting

love
the

i
just
saw
the

unbroken
very
good
except
i
thought
the
ending
was
weak,
no
retribution
and
we
complain
about
waterboarding
vladimir
putin
said
today
about
hillary
and
dems
in
my
opinion,
it
is
humiliating
one
must
be
able

lose
with
dignity

true

thought
that

get
better
after
they
failed
so
badly
in

they
are
worse
wow,
the
@nytimes

losing
thousands
of

because
of
their
very
poor

highly
inaccurate

why

that
but
why
announce
the
@nytimes
states
today
that
djt
believes
more
countries
should
acquire
nuclear
weapons
how
dishonest
are
they
i
never
said
this
'jeff
sessions,
a
fitting
selection
for
attorney
general'
https//tco/ljktkazsfy
the
@nytimes
sent
a
letter
to
their
subscribers
apologizing
for
their
bad
coverage
of
me
i
wonder
if
it
will
change
doubt
it
australia,
new
zealand,
and
more
i
am
always
available
to
them
@nytimes
is
just
upset
that
they
looked
like
fools
in
their
coverage
of
me
just
met
with
general
petraeuswas
very
impressed
i
am
not
trying
to
get
top
level
security
clearance
for
my
children
this
was
a
typically
false
news
story
in
addition
to
winning
the
electoral
college
in
a
landslide,
i
won
the
popular
vote
if
you
deduct
the
millions
of
people
who
voted
illegally
a
fantastic
day
in
dc
met
with
president
obama
for
first
time
really
good
meeting,
great
chemistry
melania
liked
mrs
o
a
lot
during
a
general
election
i,
for
one,
am
appalled
that
somebody
that
is
the
nominee
of
one
of
our
two
major
parties
would
take
that
kind
i
will
be
going
to
indiana
on
thursday
to
make
a
major
announcement
concerning
carrier
ac
staying
in
indianapolis
great
deal
for
workers
and
fair
elections
we've
accepted
the
outcomes
when
we
may
not
have
liked
them,
and
that
is
what
must
be
expected
of
anyone
standing
on
a
i
have
recieved
and
taken
calls
from
many
foreign
leaders
despite
what
the
failing
@nytimes
said
russia,
uk,
china,
saudi
arabia,
japan,
@fiiibuster
@jeffzeleny
pathetic
you
have
no
sufficient
evidence
that
donald
trump
did
not
suffer
from
voter
fraud,
shame
bad
reporter
i
cancelled
today's
meeting
with
the
failing
@nytimes
when
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
meeting
were
changed
at
the
last
moment
not
nice
busy
day
planned
in
new

will
soon
be
making
some
very
important
decisions
on
the
people
who
will
be
running
our
government
'donald
trump
is
already
helping
the
working
class'
https//tco/gtuncqhlyx
i
settled
the
trump
university
lawsuit
for
a
small
fraction
of
the
potential
award
because
as
president
i
have
to
focus
on
our
country
general
james
mad
dog
mattis,
who
is
being
considered
for
secretary
of
defense,
was
very
impressive
yesterday
a
true
general's
general
@cnn
is
so
embarrassed
by
their
total
100%
support
of
hillary
clinton,
and
yet
her
loss
in
a
landslide,
that
they
don't
know
what
to
do
it
would
have
been
much
easier
for
me
to
win
the
socalled
popular
vote
than
the
electoral
college
in
that
i
would
only
campaign
in
3
or
4
this
will
prove
to
be
a
great
time
in
the
lives
of
all
americans
we
will
unite
and
we
will
win,
win,
win
perhaps
a
new
meeting
will
be
set
up
with
the
@nytimes
in
the
meantime
they
continue
to
cover
me
inaccurately

with
a
nasty
tone

much

what

going
on
in

and
our
inner

not
good
just
leaving
dc
had
great

with

very
interesting
day
these
are
people
who
love
our
country
if
i
win
the

we
will
swamp

ginsburg
with
real
judges
and
real
legal
opinions
i
am
somewhat
surprised
that
bernie

was
not
true
to
himself
and
his

they
are
not
happy
that
he
is
selling
out
the
third
mass
attack
slaughter
in
days
by

200
dead
in
baghdad,
worst
in
many
years
we
do
not
have
leadership
that
can
stop
this
i
believe
that
crooked
hillary
sent
bill
to
have
the
meeting
with
the
usag
so
bill
is
not
in

with
h
except
that
he
got
caught
to
all
of
my

you
can

by

reading
poorly
from
the
telepromter
she
doesn't
even
look

so
many

groups
are
beyond
happy
with
all
of
the
money
i
raised/gave
it
was
my
great

they

an
amazing

in

thousands

total
hypocrite
the

by

was
the
first

that

nice
i
have
a

in

i
should

easily
won

have
a

watch
@elizabethforma

can't

to
hear
what
you
two
talked
about
hillary
clinton
is
not
qualified
to
be

because
her

been

much
of

i
have

has
already
been

with
the

to

to

other

crooked
hillary
wants
a
radical
500%
increase
in
syrian
refugees
we
can’t
allow
this

to

why
did

@alisonforky
declare
crooked
hillary
winner
in
ky
when
ap
hasn't
even
called

i
look
so
forward
to
debating
crooked
hillary
clinton
democrat
primaries
are
rigged,

is
rigged
so
time

it
on

everything
else,
it
will
be

which
horribly
oppresses

crooked

overregulates,
overtaxes

@marthamaccallum
wow,
30,000
emails
were
deleted
by
crooked
hillary
clinton
she
said
they
had
to
do
with
a
wedding
reception
liar
how
can
she
run
over
50
women
were
interviewed
by
the
@nytimes
yet
they
only
wrote
about
6
that’s
because
there
were
so
many
positive
statements
the
pathetic
new
hit
ad
against
me
misrepresents
the
final
line
you
can
tell

to
go
blank
themselves
was
about
china,
not
women
crooked
hillary

put
out
an

where
i
am
misquoted
on
women
can't
believe
she
would
misrepresent

poorly
with
such

remember
when
the
two
failed
presidential

lindsey
graham

be

things
about

on

but
i
can't

believe
i

it

in

brought

got
second
highest

total
in

based
on
the
fraud
committed
by

ted
cruz
during

i
have
determined
that
it
is
time
to
officially
recognize
jerusalem

i
am
also
directing

for
it
states

the
reason
i
originally
endorsed
luther
strange
and
his

went
up
mightily,
is
that
i
said

election
i
was
right
roy
worked

the

was
stacked
against

always
thought
that
“if

you
will

she
would
tell
everyone
that,
“no

he
will
win”

i
would

if

don't
repeal

the

will
be

greater

though

chris

lie
about
his
brave

in

fake
news
while
on

@cnn,
bernie

cut
off
for
using
the

fake

to
describe
the

they
said
technical
difficulties
the
opinion
of
this
socalled
judge,
which
essentially
takes
lawenforcement
away
from

is
ridiculous

failure
of

only
emboldens
the

he's
been
losing

the

@nytimes
was
forced
to
apologize
to
its
subscribers
for
the
poor
reporting
it
did
on
my

win
now
they
are
worse
when
will
the

give
us
our
attorney

only
reason
the

is
that

how

sure
about

only
getting
